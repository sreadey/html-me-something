    <p> In the summer of 1960, two young kids met and became fast friends.
        Over the years they played baseball, hiked in the woods, waded through streams,
        body-surfed at Scarborough Beach, built forts, had snowball fights,
        went ice-skating and sledding.
        After High School, life took them in different directions, but, in the Summer of 2012,
        they reunited. Due to a mutual love of the great outdoors and always up for a good 
        physical challenge, one of them said &#34;Let&#39;s do a Mudder&#34;...and so they did! </p>
